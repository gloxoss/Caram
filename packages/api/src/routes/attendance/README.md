# Attendance Router Fix

This directory contains fixes for the attendance router and related database schema issues.

## Files Included

1. `router.fixed.ts` - The fixed version of the attendance router
2. `../../database/prisma/migrations/attendance_update.sql` - SQL migration to update the database schema
3. `../../database/prisma/schema.update.prisma` - Updated Prisma schema with the required models

## Issues Fixed

1. **Schema-Code Mismatch**: The Attendance model in the Prisma schema was missing fields that are used in the router code (checkInTime, checkOutTime, workHours, leaveType, notes, isManualEntry, etc.)

2. **Missing LeaveRequest Model**: The router had code for leave requests, but the LeaveRequest model didn't exist in the schema.

3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with better error messages and logging.

4. **Type Safety**: Added Prisma types for better type safety in queries.

5. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Added fallback logic when the LeaveRequest model doesn't exist.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update Database Schema**:
   - Apply the SQL migration in `attendance_update.sql` to your database
   - OR update your Prisma schema using the provided `schema.update.prisma` as a reference

2. **Generate Prisma Client**:
   - After updating the schema, run `npx prisma generate` to update the Prisma client

3. **Replace Attendance Router**:
   - Replace your existing attendance router with the fixed version in `router.fixed.ts`

4. **Test the API**:
   - Test all endpoints to ensure they work correctly with the updated schema

## Key Changes in the Fixed Router

1. Added proper type imports from Prisma
2. Added error handling with detailed error messages
3. Added console.error logging for better debugging
4. Added fallback logic for the leave request functionality
5. Fixed type issues in the summary endpoint
6. Improved error handling in database operations

## Fallback Mechanism

The fixed router includes a fallback mechanism for the leave request functionality. If the LeaveRequest model doesn't exist in your database, the router will create attendance records directly with the "ON_LEAVE" status.

This allows the leave functionality to work even if you haven't implemented the full LeaveRequest model yet.
