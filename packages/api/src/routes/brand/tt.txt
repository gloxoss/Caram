The goal is to create an Inventory Management API that:
Manages stock levels per product across multiple locations (e.g., outlets).

Supports complex operations like stock adjustments and transfers.

Provides detailed querying, filtering, and reporting capabilities.

Ensures data consistency and auditability.

Is flexible and extensible for future enhancements.

Features
Stock Management:
Track inventory per product per outlet.

Adjust stock levels (add or deduct) with validation to prevent negative stock.

Transfer stock between outlets atomically.

Advanced Querying:
List inventory with filters (product, outlet, quantity), pagination, and sorting.

Retrieve total stock per product or per outlet.

Identify products with low stock levels.

Auditing:
Log all stock changes (adjustments, transfers) for traceability.

Provide access to change history.

Robustness:
Use transactions to handle concurrency and ensure data integrity.

Implement error handling for insufficient stock or invalid operations.

Security:
Assume role-based access control (e.g., only managers can adjust stock), handled via middleware.


1. List Inventory Items
Endpoint: GET /inventory

Description: Retrieve a list of inventory items with filtering, pagination, and sorting.

Query Parameters:
productId: Filter by product (optional).

outletId: Filter by outlet (optional).

minQuantity: Filter items with quantity ≥ this value (optional).

maxQuantity: Filter items with quantity ≤ this value (optional).

search: Search product name (optional).

limit: Items per page (default: 20).

offset: Items to skip (default: 0).

sortBy: Field to sort by (e.g., "quantity", "productName").

sortOrder: "asc" or "desc" (default: "asc").


2. Adjust Stock Levels
Endpoint: POST /inventory/adjust

Description: Add or deduct stock for a product in an outlet, with logging.


3. Transfer Stock Between Outlets
Endpoint: POST /inventory/transfer

Description: Move stock from one outlet to another atomically.


4. Get Stock Levels
Endpoint: GET /inventory/stock

Description: Retrieve stock for a product, either per outlet or total across all outlets.

Query Parameters:
productId: Required.

outletId: Optional (if omitted, returns total stock).


5. Get Low Stock Products
Endpoint: GET /inventory/low-stock

Description: List products below a stock threshold, per outlet or across all outlets.

Query Parameters:
threshold: Stock level below which items are considered low (default: 10).

outletId: Optional (if omitted, checks total stock).


6. Get Inventory Change Log
Endpoint: GET /inventory/{id}/log

Description: Retrieve the history of changes for an inventory item.


Implementation Notes
Concurrency: Transactions (db.$transaction) ensure atomicity for adjustments and transfers, preventing race conditions.

Error Handling: Checks for insufficient stock and non-existing inventory prevent invalid states.

Performance: Add indexes on productId and outletId in the Inventory table for faster queries.

Security: Integrate authentication middleware to set c.get("user").id and enforce role-based permissions (e.g., only managers can adjust stock).

Extensibility: The design supports future additions like unit conversions or reservations by adjusting the data model and endpoints.
